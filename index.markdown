Hi. We're Disconnect24, an open independent service that's designing software to restore discontinued services for consoles.

## What is DC24?
Disconnect24 is a development service designed to test and provide services for the Nintendo Wii that have been discontinued.

### Well, what can I do here?

Good question! You can:

- Visit our announcements page to see what's going on
- Check out the bios of the awesome people who contribute to the service!
- Open the service status page that shows the current status of our services in a nice, clean way.
- Join our public Discord Server, which you can check out <a href="https://discord.gg/2BvqG9S"> here</a>.
- Patch your Wii's message board with our brand new mail patcher!
